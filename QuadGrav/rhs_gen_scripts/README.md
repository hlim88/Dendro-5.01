## Equation generation script.

This is based on sympy structure to generate right hand side equations of our EOM.
You need to have `python >= 3.4` to execute correctly. To run the script, you simply type:
```{engine=python}
python <script name>.py >> <eqn file name>.cpp
```
This generated eqns will be moved into `src` directory.
