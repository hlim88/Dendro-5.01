This is the apparent horizon finder which came from Jonathan Thornburg's AHFinderDirect thorn inEinstien toolkit

This Living Revies in Relativity article explains details about method and implementation about it.

This is quite stand-alone code i.e. not that many depedencies with Cactus framework so we can use for Dendro framework. Below shows what contents are in each directory.


driver/ 
	contains high-level driver routines to solve the
        Theta(h) = 0 equations 

gr/     
	contains relativity code; all knowledge of the actual
        apparent horizon equation lives in the code in this directory

gr.cg/  
	contains Maple-generated C code (generated from Maple
        code in  gr/  subdirectory) to compute the Theta(h)
        function and its Jacobian coefficients

elliptic/
	contains code to solve elliptic equations on the multipatch
        $S^2$

sparse-matrix/    
	constains sparse-matrix libraries imported from outside
        this thorn

patch/  
	contains the basic multipatch infrastructure for storing
        and finite differencing gridfns in angular coordinates
        on the surface of a 2-sphere

jtutil/       
	contains various low-level utility routines for things
        like integer <--> floating-point linear maps, fuzzy
        floating-point comparisons, N-dimensional arrays, etc;
        this is the only directory containing C++ templates

include/    
	contains common header files which don't live in any other
        source directory; all compile-time options for this thorn
        are configured here


Note that many calculations were performed with Maple which is not open source toolkit.
